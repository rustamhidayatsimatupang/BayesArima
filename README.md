# BayesArima
This code to estimate the parameters of the ARIMA model using the Bayes method. In the Bayes method, the prior distribution will be combined with the Likelihood function to produce a posterior distribution, which will then be the basis for inference. Selection of different priors will result in different inferences. Prior distribution used in this study is a normal distribution prior. After the posterior distribution is obtained, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation will be carried out using the Metropolist-Hasting Algorithm. From the results of the MCMC simulation.
